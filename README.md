## Understanding World Economy Dynamics Based on Indicators and Events

This repository contains all relevant code and data for the paper. 

The weekly data files is too big for a Github repository. You can access it from the following [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Y2aiyP6F13iRYtHscEuZAiVHIdPxeZKw?usp=drive_link). The drive also includes a ``companies.csv`` file, which is required for the company study section of the paper.

The code makes direct use of these data files, and perfectly reproduces the figures in the paper.
